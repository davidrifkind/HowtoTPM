# **TPM Interview Support for Ex and Current Tweeps**

**JOBS:**  
@RifkindD can direct refer you to the [following TPM Role if interested](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3313057493/?refId=p%2Fr3lxOVQ%2FiIfAoBfiwUdA%3D%3D)

**What is this?**  
A guide to get Ex-Tweep TPMs in interview shape as soon as possible. It lists out interview questions authors of the document have seen in the past. They do not represent questions that Twitter itself uses on TPM interviews\!

**Directions**  
Print this doc out if you can and use it to take notes to prepare and practice for interviews. Here are a few points to keep in mind while reading and preparing:

1. You know your programs well already \- this is about structuring your thoughts and piecing them together so you can tell your story  
2. Details will matter but first get a framework setup for what you want to say  
3. You are awesome. It doesn’t matter what has happened in the past. What counts is that we are here now. Now is the time to focus on the future, not the past. Put your energy into this and NOT what is happening at Twitter  
4. This is the time for you to laser focus on execution \- land your next gig, lean in to your support system and tap into your network 

**Notes:**  
We ask that if you want to provide criticisms of this guide or disagree with content that you do not simply bash this guide. We slapped this together as quickly as possible to support Ex-Tweeps (particularly those on visa). We stand by our information and the content in this document. This is based on a variety of experience working in Twitter and external experience in interviews. Trolling us or being rude will only get you banned from this document.

**Please provide feedback in a positive, constructive and logical way.**

**TPM Resume \- Protips:**

* The most essential skills to highlight on your resume are:  
  a) Program Management  
  b) Technical Acumen  
  c)Project Management  
  d) Product Mindset  
* TPMs are the orchestrators, ensure that your resume also speaks about:  
  * Cross functionality ownership  
  * Influencing and negotiation  
  * Risk Management  
  * Dealing with ambiguity  
  * Complex problem solving  
  * Comfortable with Technical ambiguity  
  * Comfortable in leading technical discussions  
  * Communicate the impact that your program had

    **Types of Interviews You Should Expect**

Almost all companies use a similar TPM loop. It will differ depending on the industry. For example it is well known that TPM in banking is a more loose structure while TPM interviews in FAANG and tech are based on structured loops. Here we will give the breakdown of interviews to prepare for in Tech / FAANG companies only. After which we’ll discuss the importance of each one and strategies for making sure to get to the next one.

1. Initial recruiter screen   
2. Optional: discussion with the hiring manager   
3. TPM screen Round  
4. Final Loop which is usually a full day effort

One final note here, TPM is not a term that is used consistently across Tech. Case in point is Microsoft that combines TPM and product management into one and just calls it TPM. Use this opportunity to understand the deep details of what the company means by TPM. 

Keep in mind that TPM at Twitter is its own organizational unit and is separate (on most days) from EPDR. Many other places have their TPM functionally aligned which IMHO is a smaller role than what most TPMs were doing at Twitter.

**Initial recruiter screen**  
**Time: 30 mins**

This is usually a friendly phone call or vc with the recruiter but it would be unwise to not prepare. The recruiter will have 30 mins or so to consider where to place you, if your background is relevant to the role and the company if you are worth time with the people in the next loop. This is important because recruiters spend a lot of time doing this and they have a set of standards that they want to meet quickly. A few tips to prepare for this round:

1. Make sure that you can talk about work / career history and how you got to this point in about 5 mins or less  
2. When talking about your personal situation do mention the Twitter layoffs, recruiters are going to be understanding of this, but make sure you’ve taken the time to know something about the company. Recruiters don’t want to pass people along who are just looking for a job, you need to sound reasonable and structured and have some kind of passion for what they do  
   1. For example, if you are exploring Expedia \- at least know what their next big thing is or what challenges they are facing. Talk about how exciting it would be to participate in the work to help Expedia to capture more share of wallet and navigate the challenging landscape by organizing all the work and making it as successful as possible  
3. Keep an open mind \- recruiters may say they want to look for other roles for you in the company \- accept it but also recognize that the chances of them getting back to you is quite low  
4. If a recruiter wants to pass you off to another recruiter, expect the worst. The chances of the other recruiter getting back to you timely is low. If possible, push to apply for the job they have if you like it, if you can’t move forward, tell them OK and move on.   
5. Recruiters aren’t program managers and even if they have been recruiting in this space for a long time the truth is they cannot really judge the depth of your programs. That said, be prepared to walk a recruiter through a program of yours. You should practice this story repeatedly and make sure you have the full end to end story[^1] down so that you can tell it in 6 \- 7 mins  
6. Lastly, I have seen recruiters recently asking tech questions in this call. I have personally gotten:  
   1. Explain what a REST API is in detail  
   2. If twitter.com authentication is failing on log-in how would you debug it?  
   3. What happens, in detail when you enter [http://google.com](http://google.com) in your browser. This was tricky because it says “HTTP” not” HTTPS”\!\!

**Optional: discussion with the hiring manager**   
**Time: 30 mins \- 45 mins**

Some companies want you to meet with the hiring manager before going through a deeper loop. This is usually because the hiring manager wants to know if you should / should not be passed off to the team for interviewing. If they deem you not ready or not good for the team’s time this is where your interview will end.

1. This is not a friendly chat with the hiring manager, come prepared to answer real questions  
2. High frequency questions:  
   1. Walk me through your largest program \- this being the top question you’ll receive  
      1. Thoughts \- come with 2 stories, give them a tweet length summary of both and let them decide which one to dive through  
   2. How do you create OKRs   
   3. What technologies are you familiar with and how did you use them previously   
   4. How did you raise the bar in your previous team?  
   5. What TPM tools are you familiar with   
3. Tips:  
   1. Examples are critical \- make sure you come prepared to explain some examples for each question above  
   2. Tools \- BE CAREFUL, this isn’t the kind of question where you say: Excel. They are looking for \- Issues, Risks, Action Lists, JIRAs, RAID logs, Schedules. How did you organize *all the things?*  These things are the dirty underbelly of the \#TPMLife, come prepared to talk in depth on these items  
   3. OKRs \- they suck but make sure you can differentiate between Milestones, deliverables and OKRs that are linked to company strategy  
   4. Be succinct and specific with your answer. Balance between over communication and under communication, when you tend to elaborate the crux of your answer may get lost and sometimes can lead to further questions. While, under communication may lead to missing out on adding context, underlying details.   
   5. Be conscious of how you use **I/ ME vs WE/ US**, highlight your contributions to the program and how you have enabled the team to move towards the finish line. Sometimes the boundaries of these contributions tend to get hazy, especially when you are in a cross-functional role and it becomes essential for you to indicate your impact as a TPM.   
   6. Technologies you aren't familiar with, isn’t necessarily a deal breaker. We believe that this should be tied back to your program experience. For example, if you were preparing the program to migrate the company from IPv4 to IPv6 you’re going to want to talk about how you learned networking, made use of the command line to work with engineers on gathering information and where able to get on a deeper level to understand the networking space. You need to show proficiency that you *clearly can understand the material but perhaps not be hands on with it.*  
   7. Be thorough with your preparation, ensure you know the nitty-gritties of your program, ex: know why a certain tech stack/ database was used? Why was a certain technical decision made? 

**TPM screen Round**  
Time: 45 mins \- 1 hour

This is it, you made it to your first full interview (OMFG WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ROUNDS).  
This round usually consists of one TPM interviewing you \- sometimes this is called the phone screen (but who does this over phones anymore?\!). You’re going to get a set of general and broad questions that you need to be prepared for. This is usually a mix of behavioral, program, stakeholder and tech related questions. Treat this as a final round interview and you should be fine. Question list is later in this document with strategies on how to prepare for the questions.

**Final Loop**  
**Time:** 4 \- 5 hours depending on company

The loop is a variety of multiple interviews focused on different areas of TPM’ing. You can expect a selection of the following types of interviews:

1. Program Management \- diving deep into the weeds of a program of the interviewers choice \- that is you should give the interviewer a choice if you feel comfortable  
2. Leadership and Stakeholder and Communication Management \- how did you manage VP level stakeholders  
3. Tech Program Deep Dive[^2] \- Details of what your program meant on a technical level \- logically walk the interviewer through the tech parts of your program and the technical decisions you made in the program   
4. Top Grading \- although this is different for every company there may be some kind of interview that will walk through your background or resume. This will likely be a detailed walk through your past jobs/roles and what you did there

**Interview Question Prep**  
This is a dump of the interview questions we are familiar with. We’ll give some notes on how to prepare for each one. If you need help strategizing for a question contact us. Given the speed with which we want to get this into the hands of Tweeps, we’re not organizing the questions by interview. Our general recommendation is to prepare for as many of these as possible. We’ll try to tag these questions with the interview you may see them in.

**Key tip:** remember SBI format\! You want to prepare a detailed end to end answer for each question. We would generally recommend that end to end means the following things (add or subtract from this depending on your situation and the question):

- How did you get the program and run initiation  
- How did you ID stakeholders  
- How did you interact with product and get business information  
- How did you identify the technologies that needed to be built or put another way, how did you move from the “as-is” solution to the “to be” solution state?  
- How did you create the program, track and setup the infrastructure?  
- How did you create milestones  
- How did you form the work working group  
- How did you communicate to executive management  
- How did you track progress, Risks, Issues, Action Items  
- How did you form OKRs  
- How did you finish the program?  
- Are you really done at delivery? Is there a phase 2? Did you deliver what you set out to deliver? Did you hand this off to another TPM? Do not forget closing a program is just as important as initiation
